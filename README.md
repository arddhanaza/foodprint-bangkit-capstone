# Foodprint - A Bangkit Capstone Project

## Background
As a human being, obviously we need food to survive. But how many realize that our food is able to contribute to climate change? In general, our daily food consumption also produces a carbon footprint that causes climate change. According to BBC Goodfood, a carbon footprint is the total climate impact of an activity or item: from its creation, transportation and use to its destruction or wastage. Additionally, according to University of Michigan (2020) food accounts for 10-30% of a householdâ€™s carbon footprint. Based on this problem, our team wants to slightly reduce the possibility of climate change by tracking the daily carbon footprint from food that we consume.

## Documentation
1. Download and Prepare Datase
2. Split Dataset into Train, Val, Test/Eval
3. Build a tensorflow model then train it then test its accuracy.
4. Save model and convert into TfLite, and TFJS.
5. Build Android Apps, and import the model.
6. Build a simple HTML pages to load the TFJS using javascript.
7. Test the apps.
